Autorip.sh -- RIP a dvd with multiple subtitles and audio tracks into a single
Matroska file at a very high quality using H.264 encoding and deinterlacing

 *** NO WARRANTIES, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN ***

- Make sure there's enough space in $CWD :) as it's used as temp space.
- The DVD is read several times so you'll probably prefer to rip from an image.
  e.g. run:

  $ dd if=/dev/scd0 of=my.iso
  $ autorip.sh -d my.iso

- run with 'nice', preferably in 'screen'. Refer to the nice(1) and screen(1)
  manual pages for details.

- Run with '-h' for help and description of options.
  $ autorip.sh -h

TODO:
	- more error checking of arguments
	- automatically create image file if argument is a real DVD reader
	- see if ripping time can be optimized without cost of quality
	- add recoding support (not just DVDs but any video/subtitle combinations)
